# Math_in_your_head
Allows user to cheat at the multiplication table quiz and/or drinking game Cheese and Potatoes.

-----------------------
INTRODUCTION
-----------------------
Math_in_your_head allows you to cheat by using your computer in addition to your booze-addled brain while playing the drinking game “Cheese and Potatoes.”  It determines, for any given nunber, what should be said to avoid needing to drink.  This program is a last-ditch attempt to keep you sober and functional if you lack the will-power to say “no” when your friends suggest this silly game.

The game involves a bunch of tipsy people sitting in a circle and taking turns counting, starting at 1.  When, for example, a person’s number is divisible by 5, they say “cheese” instead of the number.  (See below for other rules.)  Counting continues with the next person reciting the next number.  When someone forgets the next number or the rules of division, they take a drink.  This program thinks faster than you can, use it.

Rules:
If a number is divisible by 5, say “cheese” instead of the number.
If a number is divisible by 3, say “potatoes” instead of the number.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say “cheese and potatoes” instead of the number.
